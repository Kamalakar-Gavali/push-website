Blockchains are decentralized and made up of digitally recorded data in a chain of packages called &quot;blocks&rdquo;. The manner in which these blocks are linked is chronological, meaning that the data is very difficult to alter once recorded. Since the ledger may be distributed all over the world (across several &quot;nodes&rdquo; which usually replicate the ledger) this means there is no single person making decisions or otherwise administering the system (such as an operator of a cloud computing system), and that there is no centralized place where it is located either.\n                </Para>\n\n                <Para margin=\"20px 0px 0px 0px\">\n                Accordingly, by design, a blockchain’s data cannot be changed or deleted and is said to be &quot;immutable&rdquo;. This may affect your ability to exercise your rights such as your right to erasure (&quot;right to be forgotten&rdquo;), or your rights to object or restrict processing of your personal data.
